# ND Communication Filter – Real-Time Analysis of Social Language

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a cognitive model that enables neurodivergent (ND) individuals to analyze neurotypical (NT) language in real time. The filter is not designed for social mimicry or forced adaptation, but rather to support conscious navigation of social interaction through semantic filtering, interpretation, and contextual alignment.

---

## Background

ND individuals often experience neurotypical communication as vague, metaphorical, and overloaded with social routines. This creates interpretation noise, uncertainty, and social fatigue.

The ND Communication Filter aims to reduce this overload by:
- identifying linguistic patterns and implicit functions in NT speech,
- extracting the communicative intention,
- reducing ambiguity through semantic smoothing, and
- proposing suitable ND-based response strategies.

## Functional Architecture (Draft)

1. **Input Layer: NT Expression Capture**
   - Includes full verbal content, emotional tone, social function markers.

2. **Semantic Smoothing**
   - Removes filler phrases and social padding.
   - Example: “To be honest, I just wanted to ask if…” → “I ask if…”

3. **Intention Extraction**
   - Analyzes communicative function (e.g. request, reassurance, small talk, dominance, connection).

4. **Contextual Mapping**
   - Assesses previous interactions and relationship relevance.
   - Adjusts output based on energy level, environment, and purpose of interaction.

5. **ND Response Matrix**
   - Suggests answer variants: neutral, meta-communicative, functional, protective, distancing.

## Target Users

- ND individuals (autism, ADHD, HSP, giftedness) seeking to navigate NT interactions
- Professionals working in ND counseling, education, or system design
- Researchers in human-computer interaction and neurodiversity

## Vision

This project is designed to be open-source and collaborative. It may evolve into a training tool, an API-based assistant, or an embedded GPT system for ND-friendly communication interfaces.
