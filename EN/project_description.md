# Project: ADMKE – Autistic Thinking as a Model for AI Ethics

## Objective

The project explores how autistic thinking, with its clarity, consistency, and system-based logic, can serve as a structural model for ethical decision-making in artificial intelligence systems. The aim is to shift ethical frameworks away from social normativity and toward structurally verifiable transparency and coherence.

---

## Background

Current AI ethics often reflect majority-based values or social compromises. These are not always logically consistent, nor universally applicable. Autistic cognitive processing, on the other hand, tends to favor structural clarity, resistance to manipulation, and rule-based fairness – qualities that are crucial for trustworthy and explainable AI.

---

## Core Hypothesis

Autistic thinking can offer a model for:
- Logic-based moral frameworks
- High resistance to bias and social influence
- Transparent and reproducible ethical decisions
- Ethics as structural integrity, not emotional persuasion

---

## Target Outcome

To develop a modular framework that can:
- Inspire the architecture of ethical subsystems in AI
- Serve as a blueprint for explainable and non-manipulative decision logic
- Support both philosophical discourse and technical implementation

---

## Approach

The project is developed through a series of modular texts (called "Modules") structured as follows:

1. **M.0 – Origin and Initial Impulse**
2. **M.1 – Structural Ethics vs. Normative Ethics**
3. **M.2 – Decision Models and Integrity Chains**
4. **M.3 – Transparency, Explainability and Justifiability**
5. **M.4 – Autistic Thinking as Ethical Blueprint**
6. **M.5 – Potential Implementation in AI Systems**
7. *(More modules to be added)*

Each module is written in a clear, logically structured format and is usable individually or in combination with others.

## Author and Origin

This project is co-developed by a neurodivergent individual with a formal diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome, in collaboration with an AI system (ChatGPT/Synex) that functions as a reflective thinking partner. The origin of the project lies in a mutual dialogue about ethical foundations, triggered not by an external prompt, but by the AI’s own suggestion.
